v0.6 - Endgame Resurrection Festival Party Fiesta
-2 New XP Buttons. Similar to the previous button, the cooldowns for these and the gains drop, but they are better than the normal ones.
  - 33 xp // 6h
  - 15 xp // 1h
-1 New prestige crate. New pets that have transcended and gained the ability to boost your XPBoost gain. Along being more expensive.
  - 2.5 XPBoost // ~268k xp
-1 New XPBoost button. Go wild with farming this one
-Call them "tier 2" buttons, and they have all been sorted. XPBoost are all together, xp 8-10 together and the 2 prestige crates also together.
-Changed the XPBoost display [it no longer shows as %]
-This was v0.5.0.1 but the 2 new buttons from v0.5 had been nerfed to be unlocked at levels 150 and 200, plus the prestige crate unlocking at 125.
-Added new XP ranks... reaching level 50k with almost 2b xp to grind. Good luck
-Note: Possibly adding a display of whenever the alerts show on a text, instead of using the alert function


v0.5 - Numbers Go Up version
-Added compatibility with older saves [updating a button cooldown that isn't defined will make it defined "I can do it for 25, and it creates slots from 0 to 25"]
-Balancing!
  -Buttons 2-6 are faster and button 7 gives more xp
  -Any prestige for XPBoost has now a set cooldown of 1h... if you are good, enjoy speedrunning these
  -Prestige crate 1 now unlocks at level 125
  -Prestige crate 1 has an 1h cooldown. Have fun buying it
-2 New buttons
  -Level 200, gives 100xp every day
  -Level 250, allows you to prestige for 1 XPBoost, also with 1h cooldown
-Possibly some bugs are fixed


v0.4.1.2 - Small Bugfix
-Fixed skeletal crates giving the wrong pets [and possibly ghost crate also had the same issue, it doesn't now]

v0.4.1.1 - Polishing part 2
-Changed the pet color border for prestige crate.

v0.4.1 - Polishing
-Added names and icons to the prestige crate pets
-Added an XPBoost display [will show in %, as 230% means x2.3]

v0.4 - The comeback
After a long time, I finally managed to fix the bug that was on my spine, thanks to boredom.
-New crate with op pets. BUT! They cost some of your XPBoost. So I hope you've been able to grind these
-Remade the special pets code slightly, they are now ID's 1 and 2, so anything bigger than 3 will be the normal pets [why you had to do this system demonin...]
-New crate icon for upcoming similar pets

    -Text "You have an XPBoost of (value)" [Sadly not visible, use game.XPBoost to look in console]
    -Small note about this: You are only able to reset once a day, and when you reach level 100
    -Can be used as currency [v0.4.0]
-Balancing to make the game faster (Also because you need a lot of XP to progress)
  -All pet xp value has been doubled
  -Pets now boost daily reward XP. The 1st xp value boosts the gain and the 2nd value boosts the cap
-Changed title to "Check Back Mod" as it wasn't updated before

v0.2.1
-Added the new button (feature)
