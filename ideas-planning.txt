v0.9 ideas:
-A new Pet crate [Progress: Only missing the crate icon]
  -Costs 500 Coins
  -12h cooldown [base, expect to be like 4h when you unlock it]
  -Worst pets are around x150 xp gain
  -Best pets reach like... x5k or x10k xp, somewhere around that [but they are like ~1/2k or rarer]
-A new stats button [Progress: Added]
  -Could be like x3 the rewards but with 6h base cooldown
-New area [Confirmed, unlock maybe level 75k]
  -Maybe buffed xp drops
-More upgrades [like an extra row of expensive upgrades]
  -Uses some of the new pets
  -They could range from level 50k to like level 1m [where new feature would kick in]

Upgrade ideas:
 -x2 xp [additive, 3-4 levels]
 -x2 stats
 -+40% xpboost
 -x2 looting boost
 -/1.1 all button cooldown
 -Next update upgrade [would not be added], which would unlock the next feature

-Early pets would be buffed slightly [to make the power curve feel better]
-Code re-structure



----------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 ideas:
-Time shards! definitively not an antimatter dimensions reskin where buttons would give the lower dimension, and the 1st one gives time shards
 -These could have a passive boost, or be used for other stuff
 -Time shards would be required for upgrades and stronger stuff


1st Dimension: 1 Time Shard / 5 minutes
  -Unlock: One expensive upgrade
2nd Dimension: 1 D1 / 30 minutes
  -Unlock: 10 Time Shards
  -Extra: Time Shards boost the item cooldowns stat (Log10(x))/(10+Log10(sqrt(x)))
3rd Dimension: 1 D2 / 2 hours
  -Unlock: 100 Time Shards
  -Extra: D1 multi x2
4th Dimension: 1 D3 / 6 hours
  -Unlock: 10k Time Shards

Dimension reset
  -Requirement: 1m Time Shards + something else [like a level, there would also be an upgrade for increasing xp gains even more]
  -Resets current dimension progress

5th Dimension: 1 D4 / 1 day
  -Unlock: 1b Time Shards + having done the reset

Future reference:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
