v0.6.5 [code clearance]
Done:
-Visuals like the xp bar and selected pets are now fixed on the screen. Scrolling will only affect buttons
-Pet XP Boosts were made simpler [compressed all xp-related things to only 1 stat]
-Prestige button 3 buffed [2.5 --> 4 XPBoost]
-Added Dancing Skeleton as filler pet for pet ID reasons
-Special pets have been "removed" and now

v0.7 ideas [new feature]
-Something being unlocked at level 1000? [Combat]
   -3 New stats [hp, damage, defense]
   -Crate like enemy picking with stats [rarer = tougher]
     -Pet inventory like enemy display
   -Drop tier [rewards would be tier-based and stat-based, so tougher enemies give more loot]
     -XP rewards
     -XPBoost rewards [very small]
   -Some new resource
