v0.8 ideas
Shop-like feature
Upgrades require coins and pets [yes, your 300 green butterflies will be useful]
Upgrades will give a small boost to something [something like an upgrade can be an extra dmg]
Hukutka reached level 3666 after the update. Next update could possibly be at level 1500 or 2000, depending on how the progression feels

Upgrade Ideas:

Increased XP gain
Increased XPBoost gain
Button cooldowns are a little bit faster
More fighting stats [like an hp boost, a dmg boost and a def boost]
Some new unlocks [like a new XP button...]
Make the XPBoost softcap better
Make it fight more times
