Stuff I should do before the next update [update: Stuff I should do and publish before starting to work with v1.0]

-Button display should be looped [can be done using the objects]
-Add a flickering [like daily/fighting tab] for any tab [a button is ready indicator]
   -This is almost finished, needs some stuff to be done
   -Make sure that the fighting tab doesn't light up because of not unlocked buttons [comes with the above thing] [it's a bug that I should fix for v0.9.2.1]




----------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 ideas:
-Time shards! definitively not an antimatter dimensions reskin where buttons would give the lower dimension, and the 1st one gives time shards
 -These could have a passive boost, or be used for other stuff
 -Time shards would be required for upgrades and stronger stuff


1st Dimension: 1 Time Shard / 5 minutes
  -Unlock: One expensive upgrade
2nd Dimension: 1 D1 / 30 minutes
  -Unlock: 10 Time Shards
  -Extra: Time Shards boost the item cooldowns stat (Log10(x))/(10+Log10(sqrt(x)))
3rd Dimension: 1 D2 / 2 hours
  -Unlock: 100 Time Shards
  -Extra: D1 multi x2
4th Dimension: 1 D3 / 6 hours
  -Unlock: 10k Time Shards

Dimension reset
  -Requirement: 1m Time Shards + something else [like a level, there would also be an upgrade for increasing xp gains even more]
  -Resets current dimension progress

5th Dimension: 1 D4 / 1 day
  -Unlock: 1b Time Shards + having done the reset

Future reference:

for (let i=0;i<game.pets.length;i++) {if (game.pets[i] is in some form) game.pets[i] = 0}
