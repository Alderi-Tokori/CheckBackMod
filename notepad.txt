-Add a new button in the HTML (around line 36)
-Add some CSS to position it (around line 135 in the CSS file)
-Add a new number to the unlock levels constant
-Update the handleUnlocks function (around line 313 in the script file) to make the new button appear when you hit the unlock level
-Update the load function (around line 102) to make the new button appear when loading the page if you're a high enough level
-Add a new section to the clickButton function to give XP and set the cooldown for the button
-Modify updateLarge (around line 234) from (i=0;i<9;i++)  to (i=0;i<10;i++) so that the new cooldown actually decreases
-Add a new section in updateSmall at around line 207 to update how the new button looks depending on whether it's on a cooldown or not
Most of these are quick steps, if you get it right you can add a new button in like 5 minutes
